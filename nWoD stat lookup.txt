EVERYTHING ELSE IS NOW IN ITS OWN SEPARATE FILES.

This is left here for now in case it is needed.


== THE COMMAND ================================================================

+setstat <player>/<stat>=[+|-]<value>

illegal characters for value: : ` <number>. (but only at the start)









Sets a player's stat to <value> or returns it to the default chargen value, which may be null or derived.

(Once I get the default value for the chargen object filled.)
(have +command use stattag to allow only for 'derived' tagged stats.)

Code Flow:

* validate sheet
* validate stat name
* validate stat value (or if it has a default).

Hmm.  Validate Value should be simple once we've Validated the Stat (and boy have we validated the fuck out of it.)

How do I best set up so they can set the offset ("boost") in this, or do I?

DATA DICTIONARY THOUGHTS: 

You say, ÒIf your seeming or kith matches something in the tag list, affinity. If goblin matches something in the tag list, goblin. Else, non-affinity.Ó

Blue says, ÒVery near, though they don't scale in cost the same way. You just pay for the rank, straight up, without worrying about any ranks that came before.Ó

You say, ÒWerewolf's gifts are also bought at level, like goblin contracts, I think.Ó

You say, ÒI believe this is done because you can jump around.Ó

-- a reason to make "goblin_contract" just "contract" in the DD.

&xp.<type>: <value>??? - Willpower is always 8xp/dot.

May not be so important if I keep stat-lookup & character-advancement DDs separate. ---
