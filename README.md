THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN PARTIALLY ABANDONED as of 11/16

White Wolf Game Studios is tacitly still supporting World of Darkness 2, but 
they are either re-printing the older World of Darkness series books (in the 
'20th Anneversary' versions) or are working, as Onyx Path, on the God Machine 
Chronicles (aka WoD 2.5 or nWoD 2) systems.

In order to keep up with obligations and focus on the differences between these systems, I have moved this project to "GMCCG" at the link that will follow.

My apologies to anyone who was waiting for this code to be completed.
